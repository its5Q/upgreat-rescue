# Upgreat Rescue 2023 submission
My solution on the Upgreat Rescue 2023 hackathon for detecting people on 4K drone images while restrained on compute. Couldn't make a final submit on time, but local testing with the released private test set would place this solution somewhere in the top-10 on the final leaderboard.
